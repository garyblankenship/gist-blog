# Article Enhancement Template: The Skimmable Structure

## Core Philosophy
Every article should serve two readers simultaneously:
1. **The Scanner**: Gets the complete argument from headings alone (30 seconds)
2. **The Reader**: Enjoys rich detail and nuanced exploration (5-10 minutes)

### The H2-Only TL;DR Principle
**Every article must pass this test**: Remove all body text, leave only H2 headings. A new reader should be able to accurately summarize your entire argument from the headings alone. If they can't, the structure needs work.

## The Universal Structure

### Opening Formula
```markdown
# [Compelling Title That Makes a Clear Promise]

*[One-line hook that captures the paradox/insight/problem]*

---
```

### Body Structure: The H2 Propositional Framework

Each H2 heading must be:
- **A complete thought** that could stand alone as a tweet
- **A proposition** that makes a claim or reveals an insight  
- **Scannable** - reader understands the point without reading the section
- **Progressive** - builds on previous headings to form an argument

## H2 Heading Templates

### Type 1: The Revelation
**Pattern**: "The [Surprising Truth] About [Common Belief]"
- "The Hidden Cost of Having Too Many Options"
- "The Paradox of Expanding Awareness"
- "The Beautiful Lie We Tell Ourselves"

### Type 2: The Declaration
**Pattern**: "[Strong Statement That Challenges Assumptions]"
- "Your Ancestors Weren't Less Stressed, Just Less Aware"
- "Consciousness Without Choice Is Chaos"
- "Yesterday Wasn't Simpler—You Were"

### Type 3: The Question-Answer
**Pattern**: "[Question]? [Surprising Answer]"
- "Why Do We Long for the Past? Because We've Forgotten How to Curate"
- "What Makes Life Feel Complex? Not More Problems, But More Awareness"

### Type 4: The How-To
**Pattern**: "How to [Achieve Desired State] Without [Common Mistake]"
- "How to Navigate Complexity Without Drowning"
- "How to Be Present Without Ignoring Reality"

### Type 5: The Insight
**Pattern**: "[Subject] Is Really About [Deeper Truth]"
- "Nostalgia Is Really About Cognitive Overload"
- "Simplicity Is Really About Selective Attention"

## Paragraph Rules Under Each H2

### First Paragraph: The Bridge
- **Connect** to the heading's proposition
- **Expand** with a concrete example or analogy
- **Set up** the exploration to follow

### Middle Paragraphs: The Evidence
- **One idea per paragraph** (3-4 sentences max)
- **Start with topic sentence** that supports the heading
- **Use specific examples** over abstract concepts
- **Include sensory details** when possible

### Final Paragraph: The Transition
- **Summarize** the section's key insight
- **Bridge** to the next section naturally
- **Leave a hook** that compels continued reading

## The Skimmability Test

A properly structured article passes when:
1. **Heading-only read** provides complete understanding of the argument
2. **First sentences** of each paragraph form a secondary outline
3. **Bold phrases** highlight key concepts for visual scanning
4. **White space** prevents wall-of-text syndrome
5. **H2s work as standalone tweets** - each one is valuable in isolation
6. **Screenshot test passes** - image of just H2s would be shareable content
7. **30-second scan delivers TL;DR** - busy executive gets full value instantly

## Enhancement Checklist

### Structure Check
- [ ] Title makes a clear promise or poses compelling question
- [ ] Hook creates immediate engagement
- [ ] Each H2 heading is a complete, scannable thought
- [ ] Headings build progressive argument
- [ ] Paragraphs follow Bridge-Evidence-Transition pattern
- [ ] **H2-only test passes**: Remove all body text - can someone summarize the article from H2s alone?
- [ ] **LinkedIn test passes**: Could you post just the H2s as valuable content?
- [ ] **Executive summary test**: Would a CEO understand your point from just H2s?

### Skimmability Check  
- [ ] Headings alone tell the complete story
- [ ] First sentences create secondary outline
- [ ] Key concepts are **bolded** for scanning
- [ ] Adequate white space between sections
- [ ] No paragraph exceeds 5 sentences

### Engagement Check
- [ ] Opening creates "must read" feeling
- [ ] Each section ends with forward momentum
- [ ] Concrete examples ground abstract concepts
- [ ] Personal/relatable elements throughout
- [ ] Clear takeaway or transformation promised

## Transformation Examples

### Before: Wall of Text
```
Nostalgia is interesting because we tend to think the past was simpler but actually it wasn't really simpler we just didn't know about as many things and our awareness was more limited so it felt simpler but the complexity was always there we just couldn't see it...
```

### After: Skimmable Structure
```
## The Past Wasn't Simpler—Your Awareness Was Smaller

Think about your grandfather choosing a career. He had three options in his small town. You have access to thousands of possibilities, global markets, and endless predictions about which fields will exist in ten years.

The choice wasn't simpler then. Your awareness of the choice is incomparably more complex now.

This expansion of consciousness—not an increase in actual complexity—is what makes modern life feel overwhelming. And understanding this difference changes everything about how we approach our daily decisions.
```
