gist version
```

### Manual Installation

```bash
# Build binary
go build -o gist gist.go

# Install to system path

```

## Configuration

### Authentication Methods

1. **Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   export GITHUB_USER="your-github-username"
   export GITHUB_TOKEN="ghp_your_personal_access_token"
   ```

2. **Dotenv File**
   Create a `.env` file in your project or home directory:
   ```
   GITHUB_USER=your-username
   GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=ghp_your_token_here
   ```

3. **Interactive Setup**
   ```bash
   # Initialize configuration
   gist init
   ```

### Token Requirements

Your GitHub personal access token needs:
- `gist` scope to create and manage gists
- Optional `read:user` for profile access

## Basic Workflow

### 1. Create Content

Write your posts in Markdown:
```bash
vim my-post.md
```

### 2. Stage Changes

```bash
# Stage a new post (private by default)
gist add my-post.md -d "My Post Title #tag1 #tag2"

# Stage as public post
gist add -p my-post.md -d "Public Post #blog"

# Stage multiple files
gist add file1.md file2.md -d "Multi-file post"
```

### 3. Check Status

```bash
gist status

# Example output:
# Changes to be pushed (2):
#   new file:   my-post.md
#               ‚Üí My Post Title #tag1 #tag2
#   new file:   another.md
#               ‚Üí Another Post #blog
```

### 4. Push to GitHub

```bash
gist push
```

   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Permission Issues

```bash
# If /usr/local/bin is not writable
sudo make install-cli

# Or install to user directory
mkdir -p ~/bin
cp gist ~/bin/
export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
```

### Token Problems

```bash
# Test configuration
gist config
gist pull

# Update token if needed
gist config github.token ghp_new_token
```

### Cache Problems
